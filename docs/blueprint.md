- Text colors: Dark blue (#000080) for headings and important text, with a medium gray (#808080) for body text to ensure readability.
- Font: 'Montserrat', sans-serif, used throughout for a geometric and clean appearance. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.

- Content is centered within a 1200px container, with padding on the sides.
- Sections are spaced 96px apart vertically to create a sense of order.
- Use simple, geometric icons sized at 24px, filled with the gradient color scheme.
- Implement subtle animations on hover for interactive elements, using a fade-in or color shift towards the red end of the gradient.
